# intro-to-R-assignment

The asignment can be found [here](https://ory-data-science.github.io/semester-pharmacy/assignments/r-intro/).

For each section, either produce an R script (so a file named 2.R for the second question, for example) or a text file, depending if it is asking for code or analysis.
